# VR-Tutorial

## Overview on how the Unity Tutorial Project works:

The VR Unity tutorial project works similarly to any Unity project. You have to have the Unity program installed and a VR headset as well. In my project, I heavily focused on learning to use the XR interaction toolkit because this is an interaction system that sets up how the player controls the game when they are playing. By using the toolkit I am able to greatly reduce the amount of work I have to do in setting up the controllers and it also allows my work to be usable in different headsets. The tutorial project used the input interactions to create locomotion and grabbing interactions in the Unity scene. The locomotion aspects include teleportation, snap and turn, and continuous movement/turning. These are basic movements that are used in many VR games. The grabbing aspect of this tutorial is that I was able to give the user the ability to interact with the objects around them. This means picking things up and changing their color by creating collisions. 

## How to run the Tutorial: 
*IMPORTANT: Unfortunately this tutorial will only show how to run this tutorial on windows machines because testing on the Unity app isnâ€™t directly supported on MacOS. To work on MacOS you would have to build the project everytime you want to test it.*

Step 1: Install Unity, make sure it is the Unity version 2021.2.9. 

Step 2: In the Unity installs section, for the install you have, make sure to download the Android Build and Windows build support as well. 

Step 3: Download the [Oculus Developer](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/) Hub to make sure you can use your headset as a developer. 

Step 4: Plug in your headset and make sure it is in [link mode](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-enable-device/).

Step 5: Open Unity project, hit the play button at the top and try out a simple VR Unity project.
